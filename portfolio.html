              I was one of the team members to represent Purdue University in the <a href=
              "https://www.trine.edu/innovation-one/aimm/index.aspx"
              >AIMM ICC</a
            > competition. 
              Our objective was to design and build an autonomous boat equipped with cameras for object detection to identify the colors of obstacles. 
              The competition featured a racetrack set up on a lake, and the boat had to perform specific movements based on the obstacle's color 
              detected by the cameras. Points were awarded for correctly executing these maneuvers, such as moving left to pass through a green obstacle or moving right to pass through a red obstacle. 
              Additional bonus points were given if the boat successfully completed the track and returned to its starting point.
            </p>
            <div style="height: 5px;"></div>
          
          <p>
            I was part of the computer vision team, responsible for designing the data pipeline for the cameras to perform obstacle detection. 
            The other teams included the mechanical team, which handled the physical mountings on the boat and ensured all systems had power, 
            and the navigation team, which used the computer vision detections (including distance data) and GPS coordinates for navigation.
          </p>
          <div style="height: 5px;"></div>

          <p>
          We published a technical report detailing our process as part of the judging for the AIMM competition. 
          Unfortunately, due to a late start and extremely bad weather, Purdue's performance in the competition was not as strong as we had hoped. 
          Despite these challenges, we successfully developed a fully remote-controlled boat with a working computer vision system capable of detecting buoys 
          and calculating their GPS coordinates based on their distance from the camera for navigation purposes. 
          Additionally, we placed second in the presentation section of the competition, which was based on our report and an on-site presentation given to the judges.

        <h3>Dream Housing Loan Prediction</h3>
        <div class="column project">
          <img src="images/binary.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 650px;" />
          <p>
            To tackle the loan eligibility prediction problem for  <a
            href="https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/practice-problem-loan-prediction-iii/#ProblemStatement"
            >Dream Housing Finance company</a
          >,
            I embarked on a comprehensive data analysis journey. Through exploratory data analysis, 
            I gained insights into the variables and their distributions, visualizing the relationships 
            between features and loan approval status. I encountered a noticeable class imbalance, 
            with a significant difference between approved and rejected loans.
          </p>
          <div style="height: 5px;"></div>

          <p>
            Handling missing values was crucial, and I applied appropriate imputation methods based on variable distributions. 
            Skewed numerical variables underwent log transformations, aligning them with a normal distribution and improving 
            the performance of machine learning algorithms. Dealing with outliers involved visualizing and removing them using 
            box whisker plots and the interquartile range. This step ensured that the model focused on underlying patterns 
            rather than being influenced by extreme values.
          </p>
          <div style="height: 5px;"></div>

          <p>
            Categorical variables were transformed into numerical representations using one-hot encoding, expanding them into binary columns. 
            This prepared the dataset for modeling with powerful machine learning algorithms. To address class imbalance, 
            I employed the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE), generating synthetic samples of the minority class. 
            This balanced the class distribution and improved the model's ability to learn from representative data.
          </p>
          <div style="height: 5px;"></div>

          <p>
            Using eleven popular classifiers, I compared their performance and identified the top performers based on accuracy. Decision Tree, 
            Random Forest, Extra Trees, Gradient Boosting, and Multiple Layer Perceptron emerged as the most accurate classifiers. 
            To further boost accuracy and robustness, I implemented an ensemble modeling approach using the Voting Classifier. 
            This technique combined the predictions of selected models, resulting in a 77.8% accuracy for loan eligibility prediction. 
            The Voting Classifier harnessed the collective power of multiple models, elevating the overall performance of the system.

            This project is a machine learning project focused on classifying images of five actors: Emily Blunt, John David Washington, 
            Michelle Yeoh, Saoirse Ronan, and Tony Leung. It covers various aspects of data science and machine learning, 
            including data collection, data cleaning, feature engineering, model building, model fine-tuning, and model deployment. 
          </p>
          <div style="height: 5px;"></div>
          <p>
            Data collection involved utilizing the Fatkun Chrome tool to download images of the celebrities from sources like Google Images and Bing Images.
            Fatkun is a powerful and user-friendly Google Chrome extension that simplifies the process of bulk image download from web pages.
            It provides an intuitive interface that allows users to easily select and save multiple images with just a few clicks. 
            The decision to use Fatkun for image collection is based on its ease of use and time efficiency. 
            This approach eliminates the need for coding and reduces the complexity of the data collection workflow.
          </p>
          <div style="height: 5px;"></div>

          <p>
            Data cleaning involved two tasks: face detection and image resizing. Face detection was performed using OpenCV to crop out the faces of the celebrities from the images. 
            Image resizing was done to standardize the cropped faces to a size of 32 x 32 pixels. 
            Feature engineering included wavelet transforms and color histograms. 
            Wavelet transforms were used to extract low-level features from grayscale face images using PyWavelets. 
            Color histograms were used to extract high-level features from color face images using OpenCV.
          </p>
          <div style="height: 5px;"></div>

          <p>
            Model building consisted of building three models: SVM, logistic regression, and random forest. 
            These models were trained on the extracted features and the labels of the celebrities. 
            Model fine-tuning involved optimizing the hyperparameters of the models using cross-validation and grid search. 
            Cross-validation evaluated the model performance using accuracy as a metric, and grid search searched for the best hyperparameter 
            combinations.
          </p>
          <div style="height: 5px;"></div>
          <p>
            The project resulted in trained models for each actor. These models can be used for classifying new images of the actor. 
            Overall, the project showcases the complete pipeline of a data science and machine learning project, 
            from data collection and cleaning to feature engineering, model building, and fine-tuning.

        <h3>Real-time Hand Gesture Recognition System </h3>
        <div class="column project">
          <img src="images/cover.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 650px;" />
          <p>
            This project showcases a straightforward hand gesture recognition system using Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe. 
            It involves data collection, processing, model training, and real-time detection. The webcam captures diverse hand gestures, 
            classified into three categories with 50 images each, stored under "./data/1" for class 1, and so on.
          </p>
          <div style="height: 5px;"></div>

          <p>
          In data processing, MediaPipe's hand-tracking module extracts x and y coordinates of 21 hand landmarks, 
          normalizing them through min-max normalization. These normalized landmarks form 1D arrays stored alongside class 
          labels in a numpy array.
          </p>
          <div style="height: 5px;"></div>

          <p>
          Model training employs scikit-learn's RandomForestClassifier, assessing accuracy on a test set. For real-time detection, 
          the webcam captures frames, extracting normalized landmarks with MediaPipe, and predicting gesture classes using the trained 
          random forest model. Results display in the frame, along with landmark visualizations. Users exit using the 'X' key.
          </p>
          <div style="height: 5px;"></div>

          <p>
          While showcasing computer vision and machine learning integration for gesture recognition, the project addresses biases in 
          data collection. Capture bias, influenced by webcam factors like resolution and lighting, impacts image quality and diversity. 
          Selection bias, tied to participant choice, affects data's representativeness. Data collection bias affects performance and 
          equity of the recognition system.

          </p>
          <div style="height: 5px;"></div>

          <p>
          To improve, broader datasets, more gestures, features, and complex models can be adopted. 
          These steps would enhance system capabilities, mitigate biases, and boost overall performance and fairness.

             <p>
              In this project, I tackled a Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), a challenging optimization task in logistics. 
              The scenario involved efficiently routing a fleet of vehicles from a central depot to deliver goods to 10 customers, 
              each with specific demands. What made this problem intriguing was its combination of real-world applicability and algorithmic complexity.
             </p>
             <div style="height: 5px;"></div>
             <p>
              Key technical challenges included designing an edge selection mechanism that considered pheromone levels, distance heuristics, and 
              vehicle capacity constraints. I also implemented a pheromone update system and an early stopping mechanism for efficiency.
             </p>
             <div style="height: 5px;"></div>
             <p>
              The project required a delicate balance of algorithm design, parameter tuning, and problem-specific adaptations. 
              It was particularly satisfying to see the algorithm converge rapidly to a cost-effective solution,
              demonstrating the power of nature-inspired computing in solving practical business problems.
